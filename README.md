# TODO List Applicaton

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

** For naming clarity and to avoid confussion, everything related to TODO items have been defined as Task rather than TODOs. **

As an addition to the initial requirements, a button "Add" has been included to toggle the visibility of the TODO form.

## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

A JSON server has been included to persist the tasks on the backend and be able to do REST calls to sync up the tasks state. The file db.json acts as the db storage.

```
npm run server
```

### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

### To build for production

```
npm run build
```
